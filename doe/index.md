//---------------------------------------------------------------------
// name: example.ck
// desc: An example of formatting for ChucK examples
//       ** A short description **
//
// ** More description if required ** 
// Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed 
// do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

// author: Primrose Ohling
//         Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
// date: Winter 2026
//---------------------------------------------------------------------

// code begins here, an empty line helps to separate header and code
// free range after the header
// consider exploring best practices like @import for classes 

// capitalize classes
class Foo
{
    fun void myFunction()
    {
        <<<"Hello, ChucK!">>>;
    }
}
// names should follow camelCase
Foo bar;
bar.myFunction();
