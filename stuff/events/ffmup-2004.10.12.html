<i><b>On-the-fly programming</b></i> (or live coding) is a style 
of programming in which the  programmer | performer | composer  
augments and modifies the  program while it is running, without 
stopping or restarting, in  order to assert expressive, 
programmable control at runtime.    Because of the fundamental 
powers of programming languages, the technical and aesthetic 
aspects of on-the-fly  programming are worth exploring.  This is 
part of our <a href="http://on-the-fly.cs.princeton.edu/">ongoing 
investigation</a> into using code as an interactive and expressive 
musical instrument.
<br><br>
Our recipe for disaster employs the new <a 
href="http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/">ChucK synthesis 
language</a>, which supports real-time, sample-synchronous, 
concurrent audio synthesis programming, and a highly "on-the-fly" 
style of writing code.  Also, as an essential part of the 
performance, we project the entire process on screen for the 
audience to see/follow/deride.  You will know when we crash and 
burn!
<br><br>
Everything begins with two blank ChucK programs.  We construct the 
counterpoint piece-by-piece in real-time, using the facets of 
concurrent audio programming, precise timing/synchronization, and 
on-the-fly programming in ChucK.  Contrapuntal simultaneities can 
be separated and compartmentalized into autonomous, concurrent 
entities. We can program and reason about each entity 
independently, as well as interact with other entities and with 
the program as a whole - creating, shaping (and debugging) it 
on-the-fly.
