On-the-fly programming (or live coding) is a style of programming in 
which the programmer | performer | composer augments and modifies the 
program while it is running, without stopping or restarting, in order to 
assert expressive, programmable control at runtime. Because of the 
fundamental powers of programming languages, the technical and aesthetic 
aspects of on-the-fly programming are worth exploring. This is part of 
our ongoing investigation into using code as an interactive and 
expressive musical instrument.

<br><br>
Our recipe for disaster employs the new ChucK synthesis language, which 
supports real-time, sample-synchronous, concurrent audio synthesis 
programming, and a highly "on-the-fly" style of writing code. ChucK aims 
to augment (and clarify) the audio programming & composition process by 
properly separating the audio synthesis chain (data) from program control 
flow (timing).

<br><br>
The workshop will be a hands-on, ears-on tutorial of ChucK.  <b>No 
prior experience with ChucK is needed</b>.  We will start with the 
(=>) the ChucK operator, sample-synchronous timing control, and the 
easy-as-dirt (but very powerful) ChucK concurrent programming model.  
Participants will quickly learn to write precise, powerful real-time 
synthesis programs using ChucK.  Also, as part of the workshop, we will 
show how to use all of these features to program ChucK on-the-fly - for 
interactive composition, and for performance.

As an essential part of the workshop/performance, our screens will be 
available for the audience to see/follow/deride. Ride along as we crash 
and burn!
