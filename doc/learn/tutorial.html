<p align="justify"> Hello ChucK: <br /><br /> 

<i>This tutorial was written for the command line version of ChucK.  Other methods of 
running ChucK includes the <b><a href="http://audicle.cs.princeton.edu/mini/">miniAudicle</a>
</b>(now on all major platforms) and the <b><a href="http://audicle.cs.princeton.edu/">Audicle</a>
</b>(in pre-pre-alpha).  The code is the same, but the way to run them 
differs, depending the ChucK system.</i>

<br><br>
The first thing we are going to do is do generate a sine 
wave and send to the speaker so we can hear it.  We can do this easily 
ChucK by connecting audio processing modules (unit generators) and having 
them work together to compute the sound. <br /><br /> We start with a 
blank ChucK program, and add the following line of code: (by default, a 
ChucK program starts executing from the first instruction in the top-level 
(global) scope). <font size="3"></center><pre>
      // connect sine oscillator to D/A convertor (sound card)
      SinOsc s => dac;
</pre></font></p>
<p align="justify">
The above does several things.  (1) it creates a new unit generator of 
type 'SinOsc' (sine oscillator), and store its reference in variable 's'.  
(2) 'dac' (D/A convertor) is a special unit generator (created by the system) 
which is our abstraction for the underlying audio interface.  (3) we are 
using the ChucK operator (=>) to ChucK 's' to 'dac'.  In ChucK, when one 
unit generator is ChucKed to another, we connect them.  We can think of this 
line as setting up a data flow from 's', a signal generator, to 'dac', 
the sound card/speaker.  Collectively, we will call this a 'patch'.
<br /><br />
The above is a valid ChucK program, but all it does so far is make the 
connection (if we ran this program, it would exit immediately).  In order 
for this to do what we want, we need to take care of one more very 
important thing: time.  Unlike many other languages, we don't have to 
explicitly say "play" to hear the result.  In ChucK, we simply have to 
"allow time to pass" for data to be computed.  As we will see, time and 
audio data are both inextricably related in ChucK (as in reality), and 
separated in the way they are manipulated.  But for now, let's generate 
our sine wave and hear it by adding one more line:
<font size="3"><pre>
      // connect sine oscillator to D/A convertor (sound card)
      SinOsc s => dac;

      // allow 2 seconds to pass
      2::second => now;
</pre></font>
Let's now run this (assuming you saved the file as 'foo.ck'):
<font size="3"><pre>
      %> chuck foo.ck
</pre></font></p>
<p align="justify">
This would cause the sound to play for 2 seconds, during which time audio 
data is processed (and heard), afterwhich the program exits (since it has 
reached the end).  For now, we can just take the second line of code 
to mean "let time pass for 2 seconds (and let audio compute during that 
time)".  If you want to play it indefinitely, we could write a loop:
<font size="3"><pre>
      // connect sine oscillator to D/A convertor (sound card)
      SinOsc s => dac;

      // loop in time
      while( true ) {
          2::second => now;
      }
</pre></font></p>
<p align="justify">
In ChucK, this is called a 'time-loop' (in fact this is an 'infinite time 
loop').  This program executes (and generate/process audio) indefinitely.  
Try runnig this program.
<br><br>

<b>IMPORTANT:</b> perhaps more important than how to run ChucK is 
how to <i>stop</i> ChucK.  To stop a ongoing ChucK program from the 
command line, hit (ctrl - c).

 <br /><br />
So far, since all we are doing is advancing time, it doesn't really 
matter (for now) what value we advance time by - (we used 2::second here, 
but we could have used any number of 'ms', 'second', 'minute', 'hour', 
'day', and even 'week'), and the result would be the same.  It is good to 
keep in mind from this example that almost
everything in ChucK happens naturally from the timing.
<br /><br />
Now, let's try changing the frequency randomly every 100ms:
<font size="3"><pre>
      // make our patch
      SinOsc s => dac;

      // time-loop, in which the osc's frequency is changed every 100 ms
      while( true ) {
          100::ms => now;
          Std.rand2f(30.0, 1000.0) => s.freq;
      }
</pre></font></p>
<p align="justify">
This should sound like computer mainframes in old sci-fi movies.  Two 
more things to note here.  (1) We are advancing time inside the loop by 
100::ms durations.  (2) A random value between 30.0 and 1000.0 is generated and 
'assigned' to the oscillator's frequency, every 100::ms.
<br /><br />
Go ahead and run this (again replace foo.ck with your filename):
<font size="3"><pre>
      %> chuck foo.ck
</pre></font>
Play with the parameters in the program.  change 100::ms to something 
else (like 50::ms or 500::ms, or 1::ms or perhaps 1::samp<i>(every 
sample)</i>), or change 1000.0 to 5000.0...
<br /><br />
Run and listen:
<font size="3"><pre>
      %> chuck foo.ck
</pre></font>
Once things work, hold on to this file - we will use it again soon.

<br /><br />
Concurrency in ChucK:
<br /><br />
Now let's write another (slightly longer) program: (these files can be 
found in the <b><a href="../examples/">examples/</a></b> directory, so you 
don't have to type them in)
<font size="3"><pre>
      // impulse to filter to dac
      Impulse i => BiQuad f => dac;
      // set the filter's pole radius
      .99 => f.prad;
      // set equal gain zero's
      1 => f.eqzs;
      // initialize float variable
      0.0 => float v;

      // infinite time-loop
      while( true )
      {
          // set the current sample/impulse
          1.0 => i.next;
          // sweep the filter resonant frequency
          Std.fabs(Math.sin(v)) * 4000.0 => f.pfreq;
          // increment v
          v + .1 => v;
          // advance time
          100::ms => now;
      }
</pre></font>
Name this moe.ck, and run it:
<font size="3"><pre>
      %> chuck moe.ck
</pre></font></p>
<p align="justify">
Now, make two copies of moe.ck - larry.ck and curly.ck.  Make the 
following modifications.  1) change larry.ck to advance time by 99::ms 
(instead of 100::ms).  2) change curly.ck to  advance time by 101::ms 
(instead of 100::ms).  3) optionally, change the 4000.0 to something else 
(like 400.0 for curly).
<br /><br />
Run all three in parallel:
<font size="3"><pre>
      %> chuck moe.ck larry.ck curly.ck
</pre></font></p>
<p align="justify">
What you hear (if all goes well) should be 'phasing' between moe, larry, 
and curly, with curly emitting the lower-frequency pulses.
<br /><br />
ChucK supports sample-synchronous concurrency, via the ChucK timing 
mechanism.  Given any number of source files that uses the timing 
mechanism above, the ChucK VM can use the timing information to 
automatically synchronize all of them.  Furthermore, the concurrency is 
'sample-synchronous', meaning that inter-process audio timing is 
guaranteed to be precise to the sample.  The audio samples generated by 
our three stooges in this examples are completely synchronized.  Note 
that each process do not need to know about each other - it only has 
to deal with time locally.  The VM will make sure things happen correctly 
and globally.
