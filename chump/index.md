<h2>ChuMP: The ChucK Manager of Packages</h2>

</div> <!-- end center -->

<p align="justify">

<b>ChuMP</b> is ChucK's official package manager on macOS, Linux, and 
Windows. It downloads, installs, and all-around manages libraries, chugins 
(ChucK plugins), tools, datasets, etc. so that you don't have to ([browse 
all available packages](../release/chump/)). There is a growing list of 
installable packages from both the ChucK community and ChucK Team. On 
macOS and Windows, ChuMP is bundled with the [**ChucK 
distribution**](../release/) since `1.5.5.0`, and is available as the 
command `chump` in your terminal. If you are on Linux, see [**Building for 
Linux**](./linux-build.html).

ChuMP was created by <a href="https://nicholasshaheed.com/">Nick 
Shaheed</a> with support from the <a href="../doc/authors.html">ChucK 
Team</a>.
