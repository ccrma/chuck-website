<h2>How to Use ChuMP</h2>

</div> <!-- end center -->

<p align="justify">

ChuMP is bundled with the ChucK installer since `1.5.5.0` and is available as the command `chump` in your terminal. If you are on Linux, see [**Building for Linux**](../building_for_linux).

To install a package:

```txt
chump install WarpBuf
```

The `chump install` command downloads a package and stores it in a special `packages` directory. If you are on MacOS or Linux, this will be in `~/.chuck/packages` and if you are on Windows it's located at `C:\Users\<UserName>\Documents\chuck\packages`. Each package is a folder inside `packages` that contains all of the package's files.
