------------------

0.1.3 (October 2025)
=======
Inaugural SMucK Version Log! Major updates to all classes
============
(updated) examples:
  - (added) `playback-pos.ck` demonstrates playback position manipulation
  - (added) `playback-rate.ck` demonstrates playback rate manipulation
  - (added) `note-data.ck` shows how to use the `data()` and `text()` parameters of ezNote
  - (added) `score-edit.ck` for score editing functions
  - (updated) `score-set.ck` shows how to build up a score from the measure level up
  - (updated) updated old examples and ezInstruments to reflect latest changes
(updated) ezNote
  -(added) new constructor using SMucKish string
  -(added) `data()` new parameter for holding arbitrary user data (float[])
  -(added) `text()` new parameter for holding text annotation (string)
  -(updated) `print()` now shows pitch as both MIDI number and string 
(updated) ezMeasure
  -(added) `notes()` get/set for the ezNotes in the measure
  -(added) `add()` add ezNote(s) to measure
  -(added) `sort()` sorts notes (in-place) by onset time, implemented with quicksort
  -(updated) `clearMeasure()` is now `rest()`, turns all notes into rests (not deletion)
(updated) ezPart
  -(added) `measures()` get/set for the ezMeasures in the part
  -(reworked) `addMeasure()`, `addMeasures()` are now a unified `add()` function
  -(reworked) `insertMeasure()`, `insertMeasures()` are now a unified `insert()` function
  -(reworked) `replaceMeasure()`, `replaceMeasures()` are now a unified `replace()` function
  -(reworked) `duplicateMeasure()`, `duplicateMeasures()` are now a unified `duplicate()` function
  -(reworked) `deleteMeasure()`, `deleteMeasures()` are now a unified `erase()` function
  -(reworked) `clear()` is now `rest()`, turns all notes into rests (not deletion)
  -(removed) `setPitches()`, `setRhythms()`, `setVelocities()` methods
(updated) ezScore
  -(added) `parts()` get/set for the ezParts in the score
  -(added) `add()` add ezPart(s) to score
  -(reworked) `scoreDuration()` is now `duration()`, get the duration of the score as dur
  -(reworked) `scoreEnd()` is now `beats()`, get the end of the score in beats (float)
  -(removed) `setPitches()`, `setRhythms()`, `setVelocities()` methods
  -(removed) `setPart()`, `setParts()` methods because they're redundant with `add()`
(updated) ezScorePlayer
  -(added) new constructor to initialize with score and instruments together
  -(added) `startPos()` set the playback start position in beats or dur
  -(added) `endPos()` set the playback end position in beats or dur
  -(updated) `pos()` set the playback position in beats or dur
  -(removed) `playhead()` method, replaced with getter for `pos()`
  -(reworked) `setInstrument()`/`setInstruments()` are now a unified `instruments()` get/set function
  -(reworked) preview instruments get automatically cleaned up/disconnected from dac when new instruments are set
  -(reworked) internal tick function works differently now: `_tatum` is now a float value representing a fractional beat value, instead of a dur.
(updated) ezInstrument
  -(reworked) `setVoices()` is now `numVoices()`, get/set the number of voices are allocated for the instrument
  -ezMidiInst, ezOscInst, ezExternalInst, ezDefaultInst all updated to reflect new changes
