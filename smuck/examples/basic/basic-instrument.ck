    //--------------------------------

        oscs[i] => g;

    // Implement required noteOn and noteOff functions
    //--------------------------------

    // What our instrument does when a note is played (this function is called automatically by the score player)
    fun void noteOn(ezNote note, int voice) // noteOn and noteOff must have these arguments!

        Std.mtof(note.pitch()) => oscs[voice].freq; // pitches are MIDI note numbers (e.g. 60 is middle C)
        note.velocity() => oscs[voice].gain; // ezNote velocities are float values 0.0-1.0
    }

    // What our instrument does when a note is released (this function is called automatically by the score player)
    fun void noteOff(ezNote note,int voice)
    {
        0 => oscs[voice].gain;
    }
}

// Create simple score
ezPart part0("a3 b c d e f g a");
ezPart part1("c5 d e f g a b c");
ezScore score;
score.add([part0, part1]);

// Create our instruments (1 for each part)
basicInst bass => dac;
basicInst treble => dac;

// Set the instruments for each part
ezScorePlayer player(score);

// Play the score
player.play();

// Let time pass until the score is finished playing
